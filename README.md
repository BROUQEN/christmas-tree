# Chrismas tree made with coding only!

## I made this project to learn html (and get better grade at uni first semester)

### What I have done:
* ~~Add floating options window~~
* ~~Add better visuals. For example current snow rework~~
* ~~Tree height based on input value~~

### To do:
* Simplify page as much as it's possible
* Add fullscreen mode
* Add tree generating system based on settings
* Custom ur own tree (also with images ;3)
* Add armageddon mode so u can destroy the tree ;c (please don't do it)
* Add day/night cycle

fun fact: I used it as my christmas tree displaying it as wallpaper ;c
