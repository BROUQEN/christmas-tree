# Chrismas tree made with coding only!

## I made this project to learn html (and get better grade at uni first semester)

This project will be used to improve my html and css. In the future I am planning to:
* Simplify page as much as it's possible
* Add options bar on the side so you can modify tree height etc
* Add some funny stuff you can do with tree ;3 (click actions etc)
* Add day/night cycle
* Add better visuals. For example current snow.
